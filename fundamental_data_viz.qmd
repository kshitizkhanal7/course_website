Data visualization helps us mainly with the two analytical goals:

* Making sense of data: identify relationships between variables, identify trends and patterns, and gather insights.
* Communicate findings from data analysis with various audience

We have already used the ggplot to help us with EDA. In this tutorial, we will focus more on making sense of data using plots, exploring the use of ggplot2, a popular data visualization library used by the R community.

We will work with Chicago benchmarking data.
